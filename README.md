## About Me

I'm a Junior Software Engineer at **Schneider Electric**, where I work on backend services for ADMS (Advanced Distribution Management System) modules - real-time grid and outage data processing at enterprise scale. Alongside that, I'm pursuing my **MSc in Software Engineering** at the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade.

My background spans a wide range of areas: from backend web development and compiler design, all the way down to OS kernel development and custom toolchain implementation in C/C++. I enjoy understanding systems deeply, not just using them.
